Every evening, he goes to a Parisian theater to read and recount the novelist and poet's work before a large audience. Offstage, he carries a gentle melancholy, tinged with solitude. His wife, who is very busy with her career, goes on business trips to the United States; they love each other, but from a distance. He no longer has contact with his daughter, Lisbeth, whom he did not raise. When her mother dies, she reappears in Robe",
